# VLESS WebSocket + CDN Tunnel Setup

Automated Bash installer that deploys an Xray VLESS-over-WebSocket endpoint behind Nginx plus a CDN-friendly cover site. It handles TLS certificates, writes an Xray config, and prints a ready-to-import VLESS URI so you can connect through a CDN-backed domain quickly.

---

## At a Glance

**What you get**
- Nginx TLS terminator with an optional generated cover website to blend with normal HTTPS traffic
- Xray VLESS inbound bound to `127.0.0.1` with a customizable WebSocket path
- Automatic certificate provisioning (prefers Certbot, falls back to acme.sh, then self-signed)
- Optional UFW rules that allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS
- Clear post-install summary with domain, path, UUID, and an import-ready VLESS link

**What to expect**
- Full run takes about **2 minutes 41 seconds** on a 1 vCPU / 1 GB RAM VPS
- Services (Nginx, Xray, and optionally UFW) are started automatically
- CDN fronting (e.g., Cloudflare) works immediately once DNS is pointed to the server

---

## Requirements
- **System:** Ubuntu 22.04+ (requires `apt` and `systemd`)
- **Access:** Root privileges (`sudo` or root shell)
- **Networking:** A domain pointing to the server's public IP (update DNS before running)

**Optional but recommended**
- CDN in front (Cloudflare or similar) after DNS is set
- Static IPv4 address on the VPS to avoid DNS churn

---

## Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository on your VPS.
2. Make the script executable and run it as root:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   sudo ./setup.sh
   ```
3. When prompted, provide:
   - **Domain name** (required, e.g., `example.com`)
   - **Fresh install?** (controls whether `apt-get upgrade` runs)
   - **Auto-generate cover site?** (`y` recommended)
   - **WebSocket path** (default `/ws`, leading slash enforced)
   - **UUID** (paste your own or let the script generate one)
   - **UFW rules** for ports 22/80/443

**Tip:** Ensure DNS is resolving to this server **before** running so certificate issuance succeeds on the first try.

---

## Installation Flow (What happens under the hood)
1. Installs base packages (Nginx, Xray, Certbot/acme.sh, dependencies).
2. Requests TLS certificates (Certbot first, acme.sh second, self-signed as last resort).
3. Writes Xray config for VLESS-over-WS on `127.0.0.1`.
4. Configures Nginx as TLS terminator and reverse proxy to Xray.
5. (Optional) Generates a lightweight cover site to blend TLS handshakes.
6. Enables UFW rules if selected and starts services.

## Output & Connection Details
At the end you'll see a summary similar to:
```
Domain       : your.domain
WebSocket WS : /ws
UUID         : <generated-or-custom-uuid>
VLESS URI    : vless://UUID@DOMAIN:443?encryption=none&security=tls&type=ws&host=DOMAIN&path=%2Fws
Key paths:
  Xray config : /usr/local/etc/xray/config.json (or /etc/xray/config.json fallback)
  Website root: /var/www/html/
  Nginx site  : /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/<domain>
  Cert dir    : /etc/letsencrypt (or acme/self-signed dir)
```
Copy the VLESS URI into your client; the path is URL-encoded.

---

## Client Setup
- Import the generated VLESS URI into the [InvisibleMan XRay client](https://github.com/InvisibleManVPN/InvisibleMan-XRayClient).
- Ensure **domain**, **UUID**, **WebSocket path**, and **TLS** match the summary above.
- CDN fronting with Cloudflare works out of the box as long as DNS points to your server.

## How it slips past basic DPI
- Traffic rides over HTTPS (TLS) with a normal-looking host and WebSocket path, so shallow packet inspection only sees standard web traffic.
- Optional cover site content on port 443 keeps the TLS SNI/ALPN negotiation indistinguishable from typical CDN-fronted sites.
- CDN fronting (e.g., Cloudflare) terminates TLS and forwards WebSocket frames, hiding the origin and making the flow look like regular proxied HTTPS.

---

## Troubleshooting
**Fast checks**
- `systemctl status xray`
- `systemctl status nginx`

**Log locations**
- Xray access: `/var/log/xray/access.log`
- Xray errors: `/var/log/xray/error.log`
- Nginx logs: `/var/log/nginx/`

**Common issues**
- Certificates fail: confirm DNS points to the server and rerun once DNS has propagated.
- Nginx fails to install: the script continues without it, but TLS termination and the cover site will be unavailable.
- WebSocket 403/404: verify the WebSocket path matches the one you set during installation.
